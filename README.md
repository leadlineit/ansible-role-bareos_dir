Role Variables
--------------

The variables that can be passed to this role and a brief description about them are as follows:

```yaml

```

The variables above are optional. They don't have a default value, so if you don't define them - tasks using them will be skipped.

Variable 'bareos_release' are optional.
Default values for optional variable:

```yaml
    bareos_release: 21
```

Dependencies
------------

None.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```yaml
    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: leadlineit.bareos_dir, tags: bareos_dir }
```
